<p>As an essential part of census data analysis, spatial analysis
provides valuable insight into geographic distribution, demographic
dynamics and socioeconomic disparities. Derived from census variables,
SVI is designed to represent the relative resilience of communities
within a given area. Interpreting SVI in the spatial context not only is
important for managing public heath crisis, but also helps
researchers/policymakers/urban planners to better understand the
interactions between SVI variables and geographic factors (such as
transportation networks, land use patterns, environmental factors, and
access to amenities or public services).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html" class="external-link">CDC/ATSDR
Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) database</a> includes county-/census
tract-level SVI for US and each state, in the format of both table(.csv)
and map(shapefile). In addition, we can explore the SVI maps and tables
on <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/interactive_map.html" class="external-link">CDC/ATSDR
SVI Interactive Map</a>.</p>
<p>For spatial analysis at a different geographic level or using more
up-to-date census data, we can use findSVI to obtain a SVI table with
geometry information, and create maps in R or export to other tools
(such as QGIS) using <code><a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_write.html" class="external-link">sf::st_write()</a></code> from the <a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html" class="external-link">sf package</a>.</p>

<p>With the simple feature geometry, we can visualize SVI patterns and
perform spatial SVI analysis with any mapping tool. Here, weâ€™re using a
powerful package <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/" class="external-link">leaflet</a> for interactive

<p>Looks like there are a few ZCTAs with missing values in SVIs. (Upon
checking the full SVI table, we can see that most of the individual SVI
variables are 0 for those ZCTAs.) So weâ€™ll remove those ZCTAs for better
visualization.</p>
<p>To set up the interactive map for overall SVI, <code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/reference/leaflet.html" class="external-link">leaflet()</a></code>
does most of the heavy lifting. Here, weâ€™ll just add some customized
color palette and labels for the appearance.</p>
